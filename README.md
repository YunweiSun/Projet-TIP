# Projet-TIP

## Description
This is our proposition for https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/

## Usage
To install PyTorch
```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

- loadData.py
- network.py 
- train_test.py

These three files need to be in the same directory as the isic-2020-resized folder, and in order to train the neural network, run the dataLoader.py first before running training.py.
